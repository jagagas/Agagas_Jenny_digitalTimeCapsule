			<h1>JENNY'S DIGITAL TIME CAPSULE 
			</h1> 
			<br>
			<p>
			 	Jenny loves being online, a passion cultivated since her childhood. From an early age, she enjoyed playing on the chunky family desktop computer for hours.
			  Those activities included silly little 
				dress-up or makeup games and immersing herself in virtual worlds on DisneyChannel.com or Buildabear.com.
			  As she has grown, Jenny now finds joy in scrolling through social media for inspiration, sharing her life and connecting with long-distance friends.
				She enjoys exploring new music, watching videos, and uncovering the latest shopping deals, among other digital pursuits. 
				Feel free to browse through Jenny's present digital footprint and online journey...^-^
