			<h1>JENNY'S DIGITAL TIME CAPSULE 
			</h1> 
			<br>
			<p>
			 Jenny love's being online, a passion cultivated since her childhood. From an early age, she loved playing on the family desktop computer for hours.
			  Those activities included playing silly little 
				dress-up and makeup games and immersing herself in virtual worlds like on DisneyChannel.com or Buildabear.com.
			  As she has grown, Jenny now finds joy in scrolling through social media for inspiration, sharing her life and connecting with long-distance friends.
				She enjoys exploring new music, watching videos, and uncovering the latest shopping deals, among other digital pursuits. 
				Feel free to browse through Jenny's present digital footprint and online journey...^-^
