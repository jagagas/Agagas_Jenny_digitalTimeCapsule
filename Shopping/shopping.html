            <h2>ONLINE VS IN REAL LIFE</h2>
            <br>
          <p>I can scroll through Facebook market all day long. 
            I love finding a good deal or lowballing for items just to see how low a seller will go.
            Here are a few of my finds. An Ikea dresser for $35 perfect for my new room! I found this at the perfect time when I was moving into a new place.
            I never really get clothes or accessories from FB but I found this cute vintage Paul Frank shoulder for $15! Which I then flipped and resold for $50. And lastly
            one of my best finds to date is the large Ikea mirror for $20 in (perfect condition!) when it's original retail price was $130.

            <h2>ONLINE VS ON ME</h2>
            <br>
          <p> I usually shop second hand and Depop is one of my favorite places to find new clothing pieces. 
            I find the best deals on Depop and when I'm over an item in my wardrobe I'll repost it, and then it's on to the next person.
            I found some of my favorite pieces from Depop and here are a few of them and how I wore it! The first dress I originally already purchased from 
            Target but I loved it so much I looked for the same exact one on Depop when Target stopped selling it. Second black dress was the perfect find for
            an all black wedding I was going to. And the third piece is the perfect chunky statement necklace.
